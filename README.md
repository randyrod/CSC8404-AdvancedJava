MSc Cloud Computing CSC8404 Advanced Java Programming Coursework

The coursework was targeted to creating a service for a car rental company.

## Requirements

### System Overview

A car rental company needs a set of interfaces and classes to manage car rentals.

The company rents cars from its fleet of 20 small cars and 10 large cars. For this coursework,
the significant difference between small cars and large cars is that they consume fuel at
different rates.

### Deliverables

The solution includes interfaces and classes that comprise the implementation of
the system and types outlined. The code is annotated with
appropriate Javadocs. In addition, provide separate unit test classes that
demonstrate thorough testing of the solution.
